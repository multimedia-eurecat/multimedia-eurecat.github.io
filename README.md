# Website for the Multimedia Technologies Unit at Eurecat.

This is the website of our academic research at Eurecat.	
Have a look here [here](multimedia-eurecat.github.io).

If you plan to contribute, it is highly recommended to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for debugging purposes.	
So, after cloning this repo, install and run Jekyll:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/multimedia-eurecat/multimedia-eurecat.github.io.git
$ cd multimedia-eurecat.github.io
$ gem install bundler jekyll
$ bundle exec jekyll serve 
```

Then go to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` to verify everything renders as expected.

The site is constructed upon the original code released by the Allan Laboratory at the Leinden University.
