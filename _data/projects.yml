- name: PHASE IV AI
  title: Privacy Compliant Health Data As A Service For AI Development.
  description: Artificial intelligence (AI) enables data-driven innovations in health care. AI systems, which process vast amounts of data quickly and in detail, show promise both as a tool for preventive health care and clinical decision-making. However, the distributed storage and limited access to health data form a barrier to innovation, as developing trustworthy AI systems requires large datasets for training and validation. Furthermore, the availability of anonymous datasets would increase the adoption of AI-powered tools by supporting health technology assessments and education. Secure, privacy compliant data utilization is key for unlocking the full potential of AI and data analytics. In this proposal, we will advance the current state-of-the-art data synthesis methods towards a more generalized approach of synthetic data generation. We will also develop metrics for testing and validation, as well as protocols that enable synthetic data generation without access to real-world data (through multi-party computation).

- name: INDUX-R
  title: Transforming European Industrial Ecosystems through eXtended Reality enhanced with human-centric Al and secure, 5G-enabled loT.
  description: This project envisions a human-centric XR ecosystem that will transform European industrial sectors by empowering humans and creating innovate XR products and services of significant added value. It targets for concrete scientific breakthroughs integrated in technological enablers that will be applied in use cases driven from real-life needs while having the potential to be replicated in several other applications. These breakthroughs are focused on core XR technologies, namely, digitisation and creation of XR assets, realistic animation, light-field HMDs, XR media streaming and egocentric perception. To address challenges that multi-user XR applications pose, INDUX-R will implement a highly scalable, zero-touch 5G architecture and a secure, interoperable IoT network that can accommodate fluctuating demands and  minimize waste of resources. see the latest updates.
